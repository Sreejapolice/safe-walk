SafeWalk is a real-time women’s safety solution designed to offer immediate help when it’s needed most. With just a single press on a connected smartwatch, the app silently sends the user’s live location to pre-saved emergency contacts, the nearest police station, and ambulance services. The system is built to act fast — triggering alerts, calls, and messages through our web-based platform to ensure that no cry for help goes unheard. SafeWalk isn’t just technology; it’s a small step toward a safer world where no one should have to walk in fear.
